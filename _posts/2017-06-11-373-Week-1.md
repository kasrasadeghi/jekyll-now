This is my second post for CS 373: Software Engineering. I'll be
talking about Monads, projects, Python, and Group Projects.

### What did you do this past week?

I learned a lot about Monads. See the
classic [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads), [You
Could Have Invented Monads!](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html) and
[Escaping Hell with Monads](https://philipnilsson.github.io/Badness10k/posts/2017-05-07-escaping-hell-with-monads.html). All
great reads.

I've watched
[a talk about Monads in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFnhhPehpKw&t=2668s) and
a talk about [Category Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V10hzjgoklA).

I learned about lowering in compilers,
from
[this great post](http://mattwarren.org/2017/05/25/Lowering-in-the-C-Compiler/).

I've worked on a couple toy
projects. The first is [StateMonad](https://github.com/kasrasadeghi/StateMonad)
which is trying to explore evaluation of procedural code that analyzes
and keeps tracks of effects. I also wrote some parser combinators
for it, which was
fun. See
[this post](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/) to
learn more about those. The second project
is [CollatzGraph](https://github.com/kasrasadeghi/CollatzGraph) where
I was trying to make a generator for the Collatz Graphs I was manually
drawing, initially inspired by the ridiculous increase in path length
for the input of 27.

I worked a lot on the projects for the two classes. Throughout
working on them, I figured out some neat ways to automate workflow and
to integrate the workflow of the class with tooling I'm already
familiar with. I used PyCharm and CLion for the projects, and I found
some plugins that make using them very convenient.

Also, I learned a lot about managing git repositories, Tasks
integrating with issues on a GitHub repository, closing an issue with
a commit message, forking a repository, and pull request.

I've been meaning to test out development branches, but it seemed like
too much of a hassle to figure out on a one person project and not
enough benefit.

### What's in your way?

Weird Python versioning issues. The IDE I currently use has Python 3.6
installed and the class requires Python 3.5. Currently, I'm just
ignoring the nice Python 3.6 features like typed assignment and other
stuff and just testing it on a local *Docker* image for each build.

I expected the C++ development environment to get in my way more, but
honestly it was great. The *makefile* provided with the assignment
made many things great to work with, but editing it seems to create
weird issues, so I tried not to touch it and did most of my
configuration in a combination of shell scripts and IDE management.

### What will you do next week?

Next week I'm starting a group project. I still don't know who I'm
working with, but I look forward to it as a learning experience. I
think the hardest thing about the projects is definitely going to be
learning how to play to each of our strengths and weaknesses and how
to communicate about tasks, issues, and responsibilities effectively. 

The last time I worked in a group programming project was during p5
for architecture. There was 10 people in the group and we had a week
to implement a unique feature for each of us. p4 was a compiler for a
programming language, and some features that people worked on were
*ncurses*-based graphics support, compatibility with CDECL, and lists. I
worked on a type-checker for the language. Because there were a lot of
disagreements with how the feature should be implemented and how it
should interact with the rest of the code base, it ended up being a
separate but compatible project that compiled a separate language to
the lower-level, unsafe language that the rest of the code interacted
with.

I think if I had read the same things about software engineering work
in a team and about having frequent releases, the project would have
been much easier to manage, but I think that the greatest problem was
the incredibly small amount of time given to us in the project.

### What's my experience of the class?

I am really enjoying the class so far. I've learned a lot about
optimization, which has been interesting. It's also very useful to
learn about Python's exception handling and Python language features
in a more rigorous way. It's a very useful language; it's good for fast
prototyping and writing testing code, and also for writing glue
between many different applications.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

There's [this great website](https://learn-anything.xyz/) I found
on [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) that lets you look up stuff
and it gives you a tree of how things are related and what order to
learn things in. It's not perfect, but it's a good way of finding
interesting resources and relationships between concepts.

I would also recommend checking out
[BashSupport](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4230-bashsupport)
for any of the IntelliJ IDEs. It lets you make bash scripts runnable
for the project, so automated *make test* and *make build* without
having to leave the IDE. Very very helpful. Can also launch *Docker*
inside of the script, so that's nice.
