title: "Generic Programming: Week 1"

This is my second post for CS 371g: Generic Programming with the
Standard Template Library. 

### What did you do this past week?

I learned a lot about Monads. See the
classic [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads), [You
Could Have Invented Monads!](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html) and
[Escaping Hell with Monads](https://philipnilsson.github.io/Badness10k/posts/2017-05-07-escaping-hell-with-monads.html). All
great reads.

I've watched
[a talk about Monads in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFnhhPehpKw&t=2668s) and
a talk about [Category Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V10hzjgoklA).

I learned about lowering in compilers,
from
[this great post](http://mattwarren.org/2017/05/25/Lowering-in-the-C-Compiler/).

I've worked on a couple toy
projects. The first is [StateMonad](https://github.com/kasrasadeghi/StateMonad)
which is trying to explore evaluation of procedural code that analyzes
and keeps tracks of effects. I also wrote some parser combinators
for it, which was
fun. See
[this post](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/understanding-parser-combinators/) to
learn more about those. The second project
is [CollatzGraph](https://github.com/kasrasadeghi/CollatzGraph) where
I was trying to make a generator for the Collatz Graphs I was manually
drawing, initially inspired by the ridiculous increase in path length
for the input of 27.

I worked a lot on the projects for the two classes. Throughout
working on them, I figured out some neat ways to automate workflow and
to integrate the workflow of the class with tooling I'm already
familiar with. I used PyCharm and CLion for the projects, and I found
some plugins that make using them very convenient.

Also, I learned a lot about managing git repositories, Tasks
integrating with issues on a GitHub repository, closing an issue with
a commit message, forking a repository, and pull request.

I've been meaning to test out development branches, but it seemed like
too much of a hassle to figure out on a one person project and not
enough benefit.

### What's in your way?

Weird Python versioning issues. The IDE I currently use has Python 3.6
installed and the class requires Python 3.5. Currently, I'm just
ignoring the nice Python 3.6 features like typed assignment and other
stuff and just testing it on a local *Docker* image for each build.

I expected the C++ development environment to get in my way more, but
honestly it was great. The *makefile* provided with the assignment
made many things great to work with, but editing it seems to create
weird issues, so I tried not to touch it and did most of my
configuration in a combination of shell scripts and IDE management.

### What will you do next week?

Next week I'm going to start on the Pair Programming Project! I'm
really excited for it. I did some pair programming throughout Lin's
Data Structures and it was quite enjoyable to have someone to work
with.

I've found that the majority of the value was having both people there
to communicate and bounce off ideas. It was also valuable to have
someone there to monitor what was being programmed in order to catch
errors early and to work out difficult algorithms together.

### What's my experience of the class?

I've really enjoyed learning about C++ and it's semantics. We learned
a bit about *shared_ptr* and *unique_ptr* and I'm excited to dive into
how those are used to manage memory in C++. I've really enjoyed the
automatic destructor calls at the end of each scope. For me, that feature
makes the language a lot more pleasant to work with than C, especially
in combination with the STL.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

There's [this great website](https://learn-anything.xyz/) I found
on [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) that lets you look up stuff
and it gives you a tree of how things are related and what order to
learn things in. It's not perfect, but it's a good way of finding
interesting resources and relationships between concepts.

I would also recommend checking
out
[BashSupport](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4230-bashsupport)
for any of the IntelliJ IDEs. It lets you make bash scripts runnable
for the project, so automated *make test* and *make build* without
having to leave the IDE. Very very helpful. Can also launch *Docker*
inside of the script, so that's nice.
