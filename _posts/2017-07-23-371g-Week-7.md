This is my final post for CS 371g: Generic Programming.

### Reflection

I really enjoyed the class material and learning about the C++
Programming Language. I felt the material was very approachable and
presented in an interesting way, and most of the problems we
approached in class were deceptively thoughtful. Everything had some
kind of neat purpose, some clever pattern we'd use in the future.

#### Tips and recommendation

I'd really recommend this class if you're looking to learn C++ or just
become a better programmer. It's not difficult if you put in the time,
and the grading is very fair. The professor is very entertaining and
the material is usually engaging.

Everything is also multiple choice, so there's little to misconstrue or
mislead. The way he teaches is similar to engaging in a whiteboard
interview, so even the teaching methods will prepare you for the future.
